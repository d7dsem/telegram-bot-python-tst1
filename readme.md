# This is a pet-project in wich i study how to create telegram bot with *telebot* package

Now there two bots wich doesn't work properly))))

One is for translation
Another for geting weather 

For translation i use package *googletrans*. But it stops working(((

For weather i use service OPENWEATHER. But there was some troubles with activation of api-keys after registration
and i not check is it fixed.


For obtain bot token you need to use telegram @BotFather

For obtain OPENWEATHER api key - https://openweathermap.org/

You need to add this stuf to file .env with corresponding key, wich is not on github, its cofidential.

## Weather bot

First attempt. **src/tlg_weather_bot.py** - very simple, but working 

Do it better!

file **src/openweather_interaction.py** - contain stuff for interaction with OPENWEATHER
file **src/tlg_weather_bot_mk2.py** - better version of bot)))
